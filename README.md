M3 Group Assignment - Maria Kirk, Sofie Schnoor, Jeppe Ejstrud &amp; Esben Jacobsen

This assignment is based on a dataset from AirBnB in Singapore, the dataset was updated on 28 August 2019. There are 7907 samples. In this stakeholder report, we will walk you through the most essential analyses and results from python, so you can get an understanding of our findings.
 
We have made a problem statement, which will guide the analyses of our assignment. The problem statement is:
 
    To what extent does the accommodation features and titles have influence on the prices?
 
To answer the above problem statement we will use Machine Learning techniques on six different features, which might have an influence on the prices to see how precise we can predict whether the accommodation has a prices above or below the average price. We will also use Deep Learning techniques on the accommodation titles to see how precise these predictions are compared to the actual prices and the first predictions.
